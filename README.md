## Software design principles:

1. Data is stored locally

No networking, no need to worry about data security and privacy issues. It provides space track recording function based on mobile phone original GPS and network base station positioning.

2. Principle of least dependence

Focus on improving location service stability, track recording, local statistical analysis and data presentation.

- No integrated map;
- No networking;
- No advertising;
- No recommended guidance;
